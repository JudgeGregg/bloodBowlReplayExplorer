# bloodBowlReplayExplorer

Drop and execute in your replays repository (My Documents/BloodBowl2/Profiles/XXX/Replays).
It will open a browser tab listing your replays in a sortable table.

On Windows you can ignore the firewall prompt and it should still work.

Clicking on the replay file will upload it to https://bloodbowl-parser.nw.r.appspot.com/ 
and display some stats about the game.
